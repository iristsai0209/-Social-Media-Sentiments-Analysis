# -Social-Media-Sentiments-Analysis
An end-to-end project analyzing sentiments across major social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🔥 Project Highlights

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:  
  Performed text normalization including lowercasing, removal of HTML tags, punctuation, non-ASCII characters, stopwords removal, and stemming.

- 🧠 **Sentiment Classification**:  
  Applied VADER sentiment analysis to categorize posts into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  Analyzed sentiment distribution by country, platform, month, and day of the week to uncover temporal and geographic trends.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**:  
  Compared SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models to predict sentiment categories.  
  - **Best model**: SVM, achieving 71% accuracy overall, with negative sentiment classification reaching ~90% accuracy.

- 📈 **Business Implications**:  
  Identified peak positive sentiment periods (June) and platforms (Instagram) for potential marketing optimization.
