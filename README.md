# -Social-Media-Sentiments-Analysis
An end-to-end project analyzing sentiments across major social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Project Highlights

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:  
  Performed text normalization including lowercasing, removal of HTML tags, punctuation, non-ASCII characters, stopwords removal, and stemming.

- Sentiment Classification:  
  Applied VADER sentiment analysis to categorize posts into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  Analyzed sentiment distribution by country, platform, month, and day of the week to uncover temporal and geographic trends.

- Machine Learning Models:  
  Compared SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models to predict sentiment categories.  
- Best model: SVM, achieving 71% accuracy overall, with negative sentiment classification reaching ~90% accuracy.

- Business Implications:  
  Identified peak positive sentiment periods (June) and platforms (Instagram) for potential marketing optimization.

I worked on a project to understand how people feel about certain topics online. First, I cleaned the text data by removing unnecessary parts like punctuation, HTML tags, and common words that donâ€™t add meaning. Then, I used a tool to label each post as positive, negative, or neutral. I explored how these feelings changed by country, social media platform, and time to find useful patterns. I also tested different machine learning models to predict the sentiment of each post, and found that the SVM model worked best, especially for spotting negative comments. From this, we discovered that June had the most positive posts and Instagram was the top platform, which could help guide future marketing efforts.
